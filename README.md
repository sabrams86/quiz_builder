## An app for building and editing flash card style quizzes

Check out the live working version here:  https://hidden-reef-5244.herokuapp.com/

Create and play custom quizzes using plain text or image urls to help practice a subject or topic that you are trying to learn.  You can play quizzes that anyone makes and see if you're fast and smart enough to make it onto the leader board.

###Cloning

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies and create a .env file in your root folder to hold your local database info.

This project was built over the course of a week during the galvanize full stack program.
